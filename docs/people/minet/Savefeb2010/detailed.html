contributing to standardization:<br>
</div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li>at the national level with the military standards GAM-T-103
and GAM-T-111 for real-time services and protocols. This protocol is
implemented in the Rafale fighters, the aircraft carrier Charles De
Gaulle and the next generation submarines;</li>
  <li>at the european level with the ETSI HIPERLAN standard, a
radio ethernet with mobile stations. More particularly, she designed,
proposed and pushed the routing protocol, at the origin of the RFC
3626. This protocol has been partially adopted by Samsung;</li>
  <li>at the international level with the IETF RFC 3626 OLSR, an
optimized link state protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks. She is
co-author of the OLSR protocol. This pxfontrotocol has been judged very
satisfying in the Boeing demonstration at Lakehurst for DARPA. It is
used by the US Navy and is required in any proposal concerning the
Mobile Network Multiple Input Multiple Output project of DARPA. It has
been implemented by BAE, Cisco, Samsung, Hitachi and
Thalès....Moreover, as resources are limited in a mobile ad-hoc
network, optimized flooding is required. A solution based on multipoint
relays (MPR) is more adaptive than a solution based on a predefined
connected dominating set and leads to less retransmissions. Cisco and
Boeing have implemented this solution. I am co-author with C.
Perkins, T. Clausen and E. Baccelli of an IETF draft about MPR
flooding. In last February, I also presented the advantages of OLSR
in the NATO working group in charge of defining the "stanag" for the
future military radio network.</li>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">Disseminating information (e.g.
service announcement, gateway advertisement, network topology in a
proactive routing protocol) or information request (e.g. route request
in a reactive routing protocol) in a mobile ad-hoc network is
frequently needed. Optimized flooding is required. A solution based on
multipoint relays (MPR) is more adaptive than a solution based on a
predefined connected dominating set and leads to less retransmissions.
I am co-author of an IETF draft about MPR flooding. Cisco and Boeing
have implemented this solution. <br>
  <br>
In the case of multicasts, how to allow a node in a mobile ad-hoc
network to receive the information multicast in a group (e.g. multicast
of a multimedia stream)? In mobile ad-hoc networks, multicasts must
optimize the bandwidth that is the low capacity resource. Our goal is
to optimize the performances of the multicast protocol we have defined.
This protocol, based on a multicast tree built in a decentralized way,
will be made more reliable in order to tolerate message loss. Samsung
and CELAR (French MoD) are interested by this work. <br>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">How to provide universal mobility
to
users thanks to mobile ad-hoc network techniques? We designed and
implemented a solution integrating Mobile IP for macro-mobility
management and OLSR for micro-mobility management in the RNRT Arcade
project (<a href="http://www-rp.lip6.fr/arcade">http://www-rp.lip6.fr/arcade</a>).
We now want to enhance this solution by managing fast mobility (e.g.
wireless interface embedded in a vehicle).<br>
  <br>
Fast mobility must be managed in vehicle communication where wireless
nodes are embedded in moving vehicles. How can we efficiently propagate
information, using the OLSR routing protocol, in order to increase
active security (e.g. better guidance and better collision avoidance)
and passive security (e.g. deviation of medical staff close to the
accident). PSA and the university of Montbéliard are interested in this
subject.<br>

  </li>
  <pre><br></pre>
  <div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
Application flows transferred in a MANET have different QoS
requirements (e.g. delay requirement for voice, throughput requirement
for video,...). Hence, a uniform processing of flow packets is not
adequate in MANETs like in wired networks. However, QoS management is
made more complex by MANET specificities. For instance, interferences
make the problem of bandwidth reservation NP-hard. Moreover, the MAC
protocol IEEE 802.11b is not deterministic and today, no MAC component
managing QoS is commercially available. For all these reasons, our goal
is not to provide hard QoS guarantees but rather to optimize network
resources utilization in order to meet user requirements. To propose
such a solution, we will proceed according to the following steps:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Defining a QoS model adapted to MANET specificites: I will
consider a
simple model allowing the coexistence of flows with throughput or delay
constraints. As noticed by Nahrstedt, cross-layer design is needed to
get an efficient solution;</li>
    <li>Designing a QoS MAC protocol. This protocol must transmit
packets
according to their priority depending on their QoS requirements and
must evaluate the QoS parameters ((e.g. local available bandwidth,
local sojourn time, ...) on each wireless node. This information is
required by the network layer for QoS routing;</li>
    <li>Designing a QoS routing protocol that is interference aware.
How to
take into account both delay and throughput requirements while
minimizing the interferences generated by the the transmission of a
packet from source to final destination? As the problem is NP-hard, a
heuristic will be defined, enhancing the proactive link state protocol
OLSR with QoS management. The QoS information needed by each node to
build its routing table will be disseminated taking adantage of
multipoint relays. First results will be published in SAWN'05
proceedings.</li>
    <li>Defining an efficient admission control that is
interference
aware. How to find the best tradeoff between a complexity compatible
with an on-line execution and accuracy?</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
Finally, the proposed solution will be evaluated with regard to the
native OLSR solution. We will show the increase in the number of
accepted streams, a better utilization of network resources, a higher
route stability and for the accepted streams, a granted throughput
close to the requested one. This work will be done for CELAR (French
MoD).<br>

  <div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
In order to evaluate the scaling of a solution, it is often necessary
to perform simulation of a big MANET consisting of at least 1000 nodes.
Existing simulation models (e.g. 802.11b in NS-2) have not been
designed for a so high number of nodes. We want to simulate the OLSR
protocol in such a context and determine its operational limits. Beyond
these limits, OLSR will operate in conjunction with Fish-Eye. French
MoD is interested by this study. <br>

The establishment of feasibility conditions of a task set or traffic
set is based on a worst case analysis. These conditions cannot only be
used for system/network dimensioning (e.g. a multimedia system based on
Fibre Channel) but also for admission control. These feasibility
conditions have already been established in uniprocessor context for
the most well-known scheduling policies like FIFO, EDF, fixed a
priorities and weighted fair queuing policies. It is not so when the
scheduling policy takes into account several criteria such as the
importance degree and the delivery deadline of a packet. Moreover,
considering only througput for flows having delay requirement leads to
an expensive overestimation of network resources. I am interested in
the establishment of feasibility conditions for scheduling policies
considering several criteria for instance fixed and dynamin priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
In a distributed environment, the dynamic priority of a message can be
assigned on the first node visited and not be modified after.
Otherwise, it can be modified on each node visited. What is the impact
of these assignment methods on the end-to-end transmission delay of a
message?<br>
  <br>
The evaluation of the end-to-end response time in a distributed system
or in a network is a complex problem. Different approaches exist. The
holistic approach, introduced by Tindell, leads to pessimistic bounds,
because it considers scenarios that cannot occur like the juxtaposition
of worst cases on each node visited. On the other hand, the trajectory
approach takes into account the worst case scenario that can occur
along the trajectory. This approach leads to better results. The
problem is how to characterize these worst case scenarios. With this
approach, I have already obtained results in the case of (i)
distributed real-time systems where tasks with a graph structure update
persistent objects bound by consistency constraints and (ii) networks
providing differentiated services. As noticed by Le Boudec, the
Expedited Forwarind class, the highest priority class in the DiffServ
model, has been defined qualitatively but not quantitatively. That is
why, it is necesary to evaluate the performances that can be guaranteed
to this class.<br>
  <br>
How can we apply the trajectory approach to scheduling policies
combining fixed and dynamic priorities or more generally combining
several criteria? Valeo (a supplier of car equipment) has expressed its
interest for this topic.<br>

With Steven Martin, who defended his PhD thesis in last June, we
consider the scheduling policy FP/DP* where each packet receives on the
first node visited, on the one hand its fixed priority (FP) reflecting
the importance degree of the flow this packet belongs to and on the
other hand, its dynamic priority taking into account its generation
time. The fixed prioority is used as the primary scheduling criterion
whereas the dynamic priority is used to share two packets having the
same fixed priority. FP/EDF* and FP/FIFO* are examples of FP/DP*
schedulings. In uniprocessor context, we improve the results concerning
FIFO and EDF. Moreover, we prove that FP/EDF dominates FP/FIFO under
some conditions. <br>
This work will be published in RTS'05 proceedings.<br>
  <br>
We apply the trajectory approach to compute the bounds on the
end-to-end response times and jitters and show that the trajectory
approach improves greatly the holistic approach (e.g; the bound on
response times is 400\% times less with the trajectory approach). We
compare the bounds provided by the trajectory approach with the exact
values provided by a validation tool developed by Steven. The accuracy
of the trajectory approach is good. These results have been recently
published in IJCS journal in 2005. <br>
  <br>
We then show how to apply these results in a DiffServ architecture
using MPLS and propose an admission control for the expedited
forwarding class. These results have been published in LNCS in 2004.<br>

success, its high nmber of applications supported, its technical
capacities and its implementation easiness. However, the state of the
art shows that no scheduling proposed takes into account simultaneously
the importance degree and the delivery deadline of a message. We have
first computed the average and worst case response times for the most
well known intra-piconet schedulings: one-Round Robin 1-RR/FIFO and
Exhaustive Round Robin ERR/FIFO. We have shown that these policies do
not succeed in providing service differentiation. <br>
  <br>
We have then proposed to enhance the QoS management in Bluetooth. We
proceeded first locally by replacing the local FIFO scheduling by a
class-based EDF scheduling, the class representing the importance
degree of a message. Simulation results show a better local service
differentiation. We then proposed CB-EDF a global scheduling policy
taking into account both the class and the deadline of a message, both
at the global level, in the polling of the slaves, and at the local
level. As the master does not know the presence of messages in the
slave-to-master queues, an estimation mechanism is used. It combines on
the one hand, prediction based on the knowledge of message arrival laws
and on the other hand, signaling (a slave, when it is polled, notifies
the master of the presence of other messages in the header of its
baseband packet). We have also shown how CB-EDF supports the different
types of traffic existing in Bluetooth (SCO, eSCO, ACL and ACL-C) as
well as the energy saving modes. <br>
  <br>
We have then evaluated CB-EDF performances for different traffic
distributions (symmetric/asymmetric, uniform or not). Simulation
results show that CB-EDF provides a very good service differentiation
in comparison with other algorithms (PFP et FPQ). Moreover, the
efficiency of the prediction and signaling combination is also
highlighted. Results will be published in Ad-Hoc &amp; Sensor Wireless
Networks journal in March 2005.<br>
  <br>
We have also shown how to extend CB-EDF, an intra-piconet scheduling,
to a Bluetooth scatternet. <br>

In an IP network, mobility is managed by the Mobile IP protocol. This
protocol is well adapted to inter-domain mobility (macro-mobility) but
is less adapted to intra-domain mobility (micro-mobility). Indeed the
time needed to update the localization does not allow to perform
handovers as fast as those of the cellular radio system (GSM). In the
RNRT project Arcade (http://www-rp.lip6.fr/arcade), with Mounir
Benzaid, who defended his PhD thesis in last July, and with Khaldoun Al
Agha, we have proposed an architecture allowing to extend the network
access beyond one hop from the base station. This architecture uses
techniques of mobile ad-hoc networks (i.e. the OLSR routing, RFC 3626)
to manage more efficiently the micro-mobility in an IP network. In a
paper published in the WINET journal, we show how to integrate Mobile
IP and OLSR for an efficient mobility management. <br>

With Dana Marinca, who defended her PhD thesis in February 2003, we
have proposed a high performance multimedia system providing video on
demand sevices. We first defined the real-time constraints that must be
met in order to ensure a fluid visualisation of video content as well
as a good reactivity to user interactions. We showed that buffers
utilization contribute to smooth these constraints and show different
methods to take into account these constraints in a multimedia system.<br>
  <br>
An important contribution of this thesis lies in the proposal of two
algorithms, FLD and ULD, to distribute an end-to-end deadline in local
deadlines. The goal is to maximize the number of tasks that can be
accepted on the set of visited nodes. We show that if each node uses
FIFO (respectively NP-EDF : Non-Preemptive Earliest Deadline First),
the algorithm FLD (respectively ULD) gives performances better than
those provided by a uniform assignment of the end-to-end deadline or an
assignment proportional to the node load. Results have been published
in Computer Communications journal in June 2004.<br>
  <br>
We have proposed a multimedia system architecture based on the
technology Fibre Channel, ensuring high performances for the storage
capcity, the number of flows that can be accepted and the
fault-tolerance.<br>
  <br>
We then modeled this system and established by a worst case analysis
its feasibility conditions to meet the deadlines of server/storage
system and server/client interactions. To guarantee a deterministic QoS
to users, we showed how to dimension the multimedia system and we
evaluated the parameters values(e.g. disk number, size of the read
block, transmission period,...) the best adapted to a given
configuration.<br>
  <br>
We then defined an admission control using the jitter cancellation
technique. This traffic shaping technique allows to reduce the size of
the client buffers and the end-to-end jitter. Results have been
published in IJCIS journal.<br>

There are several approaches to manage replicated data. I have studied
two approaches. The first one is based on a symmetric model of replicas
and the atomic broadcast: any update is broadcast to all replicas which
apply the update in the order given by the atomic broadcast. In the
paper published in the PDCS'99 proceedings, we consider a system whose
fault-tolerance is based on active redundancy (i.e. tasks are run in
multiple copies, one copy per processor). Each task copy accesses local
persistent data bound by consistency constraints. All copies that
complete their execution must complete by the task deadline. With the
failure assumptions considered (at most k processors stop), at least
one task copy completes its execution. We have proposed a solution
ensuring that the results are equivalent to those obtained by a serial
execution of tasks accessing non-replicated data (i.e. one copy
serialisability). We have established feasibility conditions for a
sporadic task set.<br>
  <br>
The other approach is based on an asymmetric model of replicas (i.e.
for each replicated data, one copy is designated as primary copy, the
other copies are secondary). Updates are first performed on primary
copies and then propagated after towards secondary copies. More
precisely, a transaction can commit after having updated only one
replica, the primary copy. Updates are then propagated to other
replicas, the secondary copies which are updated in separate refresh
transactions. <br>
A central problem is the design of algorithms that maintain replica's
consistency while at the same time minimizing the performance
degradation due to the synchronization of refresh transactions. In the
study made in collaboration with Esther Pacitti and Eric Simon, we
propose a simple and general refreshment algorithm that solves this
problem and we prove its correctness. The principle of the algorithm is
to let refresh transactions wait for a certain «deliver time» before
being executed at a node having secondary copies. We then present two
main optimizations to this algorithm. One is based on specific
properties of the topology of replica distribution across nodes. In
particular, we characterize the nodes for which the deliver time can be
null. The other improves the refreshment algorithm by using an
immediate update propagation strategy. Our performance evaluation
demonstrate the effectiveness of this optimization. This study has been
presented at VLDB'99 and an extended version has been published in the
Distributed and Parallel Databases Journal.<br>

In distributed real-time systems with persistent objects, the execution
of tasks must not compromise object consistency and must meet
termination deadlines. Each task accesses persistent objects bound with
consistency constraints. We assume that each task, if taken in
isolation, preserves system consitency. As system consistency can be
deleted by conflicting executions of tasks, we focus on conflict
management with real-time constraints.<br>
  <br>
With Soumaya Kamoun, who defended her PhD thesis in December 2000, we
have defined the ODiTS problem: distributed real-time serialisable
scheduling. We have studied the feasibility of a set of sporadic
distributed tasks submitted to real-time constraints and accessing
persistent objects that can be updated. An ODiTS task set is said
feasible iff there exists a scheduling meeting the consistency
constraints and the real-time constraints. The problem is all the
harder since distributed tasks have a graph structure.<br>
  <br>
In a first step, a general approach is proposed to solve the ODiTS
problem. It consists of three components in charge of:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>ensuring the serialisability of tasks execution. This first
component
is based on tasks partitioning into classes and conflict avoidance
within a class thanks to a total global order per class;</li>
    <li>determining a real-time non-preemptive on-line scheduling
algorithm,
able to guarantee this total global order per class;</li>
    <li>establishing the feasibility conditions associated with a
solution
using these two components. This must be done before the system is
operational. These conditions are obtained by a worst case analysis.
Worst case scenarios are characterized and modeled by means of a cyclic
oriented graph. To prove that each task meets its deadline isthen
equivalent to search for the paths of maximum cost in this graph. This
modeling allows to determine necessary and sufficient feasibility
conditions for an ODiTS task set. </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
In a second step, two particular solutions are derived from this
general approach: the first one is based on a periodic scheduling
according to a predefined sequence (IJCIS'01 publication) and the other
is based on FIFO scheduling (ACIDCA'2000 publication). As the
complexity of the necessary and sufficient feasibility conditions is
high, we propose feasibility conditions of less complexity. These
conditions, sufficient and generally not necessary, are obtained by
observing scenarios with a time granularity. Soumaya Kamoun developed
in C++ the tool OODiTS that establishes feasibility conditions of an
ODiTS task set for a FIFO scheduling or a periodic scheduling and
deduces whether the considered task set is feasible.<br>
  <br>
In a third step, we compare for a given ODiTS task set, the two
scheduling algorithms. We give the formula binding the response times
of any sporadic task obtained with FIFO and with a periodic scheduling
according to a predefined sequence.<br>

  <div style="text-align: justify;">An atomic multicast is a reliable
multicast with the same delivery order of messages for all the correct
processors in the multicast group. Tolerated failures, in bounded
number, are crash failures for processors and omission failures for the
network. We can distinguish the atomic multicast protocols based on the
multicast group view and the other ones. <br>
  <br>
An example of first type protocol is given in Emmanuelle Anceaume PhD
thesis. Fault-tolerance is based on detection/recovery. She evaluated
protocol performances by simulation. An example of second type protocol
is given by the family of atomic multicasts presented in Laurent George
PhD thesis. According to the protocol, the total global order provided
preserves locally or globally the FIFO/causal/chronological order.
Fault-tolerance is based on masking. In the paper published in
LCTES'98, we propose a reliable uniform broadcast based on
non-preemptive EDF scheduling. We establish the feasibility conditions
under which messages are delivered to their non-crashed destinations by
their deadlines, assuming sporadic broadcast requests. <br>
  <br>
In the ATR project (Real-Time Agreement), I contributed to the design
and specification of the real-time component of a uniform atomic
broadcast based on synchronized phases and failure detectors. This
algorithm has been implemented by AXLOG and submitted to scenarios
established by Dassault-Aviation for modular avionics and Thomson CSF
for air traffic control. <br>
